In the code first error that i acquired is 

1 .in prop of "WrappedListComponent" , which is an incorrect protype , as an array is a primitive data type, we have to use      	the "protypes.arrayOf". 
	so it should be like:-

	items: PropTypes.arrayOf(PropTypes.shape({
 	text: PropTypes.string.isRequired,
	})),

2. The second is in the SingleListComponet as it unnecessarily re-rednder itself every time the state is updateed. It can be fixed using "useCallback".

3. The items prop of the ListComponent is being set to null by default, which is not ideal. It should be set to an empty array instead.

4. Need to add a key prop to the "SingleListItem" component when it is required inside the map function.
