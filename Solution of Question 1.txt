The simple list component , is used to create a list of items based on an array of object which is passed in a proptypes.
It does this by rendering a un-odered list, which contains a number of single list items component.
This take following propstypes as input :- 
text := a string representing the text to be rendered inside the list item
index := a number representing the index of the item in the list
isSelected := a boolean representing whether the item is selected or not
onClickHandler  a function to be called when the item is clicked

When any user click on the list item , the compond update the "isSelected" state of the corresponding item to the value true.
and also sets the background color of the clikced list item to color green and rest which are not selected have a background color red.

In the code the "WrappedListComponent" maps each item in the items prop and also create a "Single List Item" component for each one of the items. Than it passes down the dunction "onClickHandle" , text and the idex props to "SingleListItem" and also passed down the "isSelected  state based on whethere the items index matches the selectIndex state.
